    <h5>Basic Help</h5>
    After starting the player for the first time, you need to set a few fields in the settings page. The bare minimum is the
    path to openMSX, which will be set initially to a default that you can change if needed.
    <p></p>
    After that you can start adding games to the player. You can create new listings and populate them with games by clicking
    on the + button, or you can drag and drop files and folders on top of the currently selected listing.
    <p></p>
    User data and settings are saved in default folders based on the platform ("%userprofile%\Documents\Novo Player" on Windows,
    "~/.Novo Player" on Linux and "~/Library/Application Support/Novo Player" on macOS). To make Novo Player use a local folder
    for storage (on Windows and Linux only), create a text file named "portable.txt" in the same folder as application binary.
    Novo Player will then create a folder named "portable" in the same folder and use that for storage.
    <p></p>
    Uniqueness in the player is determined by the SHA1 code of the game file. This means that a specific game file can only be
    added once to the player no matter what the listing is. In the previous blueMSX and openMSX launchers, uniqueness was based
    on the game name within the same database.
    <p></p>
    Right clicking on a game displays a context menu with functions. Holding down the Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) key or Shift key while
    clicking allows to select multiple games. You can then perform operations such as updates, deletes and moves on them.
    <p></p>

    Typing the first few letters of a game name quickly while on the listing page will take you to the first matched game.
    <p></p>
    After launching games on openMSX, you can connect to the openMSX process by clicking on the blinking indicator on the main
    listing or from the dashboard to perform operations such as reset, mute/unmute, pause, fullscreen, control emulation speed,
    take screenshots (that can then be viewed on the listing page), save and load states, type text, enter passwords (using a
    built-in database of known game passwords), enable cheats (using openMSX's trainer feature) and switch disks or tapes.
    <p></p>
    The vast majority of built-in game passwords work on both openMSX and WebMSX. However, there are some exceptions, such as
    "The Goonies r Good Enough" passwords which work only on WebMSX. That depends on the how the keyboard input routine was implemented
    in the game and its compatibility with the commands used on openMSX and WebMSX to type text.
    <p></p>
    When enabling MSX News in the settings, the player will get news from the following sites: MSX Launchers,
    <app-web-link address="https://www.msx.org/" label="MSX Resource Center"></app-web-link> and
    <app-web-link address="https://www.msxblog.es/" label="MSX Blog"></app-web-link>
    <p></p>
    When enabling games from file-hunter.com in the settings, the Quick Launch window will show a button that displays games from
    file-hunter.com (certain subfolders under Games/). When a game is selected, its URL will be copied to the file text field. openMSX
    will be launched with the game after downloading it to a temporary folder. The text field can take local files and folders, and
    also URLs to games on the Web, from file-hunter or otherwise.
