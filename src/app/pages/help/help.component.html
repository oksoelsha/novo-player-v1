    <h5>Basic Help</h5>
    After starting the player for the first time, you need to set a few fields in the settings page. The bare minimum is the
    path to openMSX, which will be set initially to a default that you can change if needed.
    <p></p>
    After that you can start adding games to the player. You can create new listings and populate them with games by clicking
    on the + button, or you can drag and drop files and folders on top of the currently selected listing.
    <p></p>
    User data and settings are saved in default folders based on the platform ("%userprofile%\Documents\Novo Player" on Windows
    and "~/.Novo Player" on Linux). To make Novo Player use a local folder for storage, create a text file named "portable.txt"
    in the same folder as application binary. Novo Player will then create a folder named "portable" in the same folder and use
    that for storage.
    <p></p>
    Uniqueness in the player is determined by the SHA1 code of the game file. This means that a specific game file can only be
    added once to the player no matter what the listing is. In the previous blueMSX and openMSX launchers, uniqueness was based
    on the game name within the same database.
    <p></p>
    Right clicking on a game displays a context menu with functions. Holding down the Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) key or Shift key while
    clicking allows to select multiple games. You can then perform operations such as updates, deletes and moves on them.
    <p></p>
    The following are the keyboard shortcuts:

    Typing the first few letters of a game name quickly while on the listing page will take you to the first matched game.
    <p></p>
    After launching games on openMSX, you can connect to the openMSX process in the dashboard to perform operations such as
    session management (reset, mute/unmute, pause, fullscreen and emulation speed), take screenshots that can then be viewed
    on the listing page, save and load states, type text, enter passwords (using a built-in database of known game passwords),
    enable cheats (using openMSX's trainer feature) and switch disks or tapes.
    <p></p>
    To be able to view which platforms the selected game was released on, and to view its box art and additional screenshots,
    you'll need to get an API key from the
    <app-web-link address="https://www.giantbomb.com/" label="Giant Bomb website"></app-web-link> and enter it in the
    settings.
    <p></p>
    When enabling MSX News in the settings, the player will get news from the following sites: MSX Launchers, MSX Resource
    Center, MSX Blog and Press Play on Tape.
