    <h5>Basic Help</h5>
    After starting the player for the first time, you need to set a few fields in the settings page. The bare minimum is the
    path to openMSX, which will be set initially to a default that you can change if needed.
    <p></p>
    After that you can start adding games to the player. You can create new listings and populate them with games by clicking
    on the + button, or you can drag and drop files and folders on top of the currently selected listing.
    <p></p>
    Uniqueness in the player is determined by the SHA1 code of the game file. This means that a specific game file can only be
    added once to the player no matter what the listing is. In the previous blueMSX and openMSX launchers, uniqueness was based
    on the game name within the same database.
    <p></p>
    Right clicking on a game displays a context menu with functions. Holding down the Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) key or Shift key while
    clicking allows to select multiple games. You can then perform operations such as updates, deletes and moves on them.
    <p></p>
    The following are the keyboard shortcuts:
    <p></p>
    <table class="table text-white">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Windows / Linux</th>
          <th scope="col">macOS</th>
          <th scope="col">Action</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Enter</td>
          <td>Enter</td>
          <td>Launch selected game on openMSX</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Delete</td>
          <td>Delete</td>
          <td>Remove selected game</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ctrl+Shift+W</td>
          <td>Cmd+Shift+W</td>
          <td>Launch selected game on WebMSX</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ctrl+Shift+B</td>
          <td>Cmd+Shift+B</td>
          <td>Launch selected game on blueMSX</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ctrl+F</td>
          <td>Cmd+F</td>
          <td>Show search field</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ctrl+Z</td>
          <td>Cmd+Z</td>
          <td>Undo last update or remove</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    Typing the first few letters of a game name quickly while on the listing page will take you to the first matched game.
    <p></p>
    To be able to view which platforms the selected game was released on, and to view its box art and additional screenshots,
    you'll need to get an API key from the
    <app-web-link address="https://www.giantbomb.com/" label="Giant Bomb website"></app-web-link> and enter it in the
    settings.
